# Project Title

Rainy Days

## Description

Rainy Days is a school project about creating a website selling outdoor jackets. The website is created using HTML and CSS. Every page has its own HTML and CSS file. in the CSS folder there is one file for each page, one for styles that applies to all or more than one page, and it is also an file for media queries to make the website responsive. Images is added in its own folder and contains of all the images used on the website.

### Changes

The project is based on the prototype that was made in figma in another course. there has been some changes to the mobile device. the change is that it's added a hamburger menu instead of a menu that has a fix position when scrolling. The reasen that a hamburger menu is added instead is beacause I think that looked better when it's a mobile device and not an app.

One of the elements I had to changed was the icons in the footer on the first page. The reason why I do not have the globe icon on my website is that I could not find it on the font awesome website, and the most similar one I found did not work when I put it in my HTML.

### Difficulties

I have struggeled a bit with making text next to an image and centering it next to each other, without it floating to different sides when making the site responsive. when I thought I had found a solution, I found out that my site did not look the same in Firefox as in Chrome, and that was because I had used margins wrong. What I found to be the best solution for me was to start use grids. I got help from one of the teachers and when i understood how to use grids everything got easier.
